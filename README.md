# Bio

>I'm 32 yrs old and a lifelong student. For all it's challenges being homeschooled for the first half of my education, provided me with a unique experience of learning how I learn
 I'm excited to be working with @codefellows as I make a career shift from manual labor and hospitality, to the tech industry.
