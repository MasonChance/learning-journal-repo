# CSS Overview

Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS allow us to modify the appearance of multiple or grouped elements within a .html file without having to hunt for each instance of the element accross multiple files and make changes individually.

## The Box Model

- ![Illustration box model](https://masonchance.github.io/learning-journal-repo/css-box-model.png)

- Content has an invisible little box around it outlined about for visualization purposes only
- Border seperates content from the next area and is by defaul invisible but can be given dimension and visibility via styling
- After the border is the margin. Margin is the space between the border, and the invisible box edge that makes up the outtermost boundary of an element. 
- All semantic elements follow the box model
