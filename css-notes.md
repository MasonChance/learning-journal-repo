# Notes for CSS- General
    -to add multiple selectors to a rule set seperate them by a `space` this creates specificity! will only apply to the last selector and only it is ***nested within the preceding elements selected***
    
    - elements will retain the styling of the parent element selected in a ruleset. pay careful attention to where you are declaring rulesets.


## Key Words and Terms
   - selectors tell CSS which tags and under what circumstances to apply the rulesets
   - rulesets are declared in *property:value;* syntax
   - Declarations are the rules you are making using the property and value syntax
   - Property is the thing you want to change
   - value indicates how you want it to change

## CSS Selector and Ruleset Reference
    - `.nameofclass` sets a class ruleset for any element with `class=""` attribute
    - ` element (the text inside a semantic tag) sets a type ruleset
    - `.idname` creates ruleset for any tag with an `id=""` attribute
