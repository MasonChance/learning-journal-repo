# Computer Architecture Overview
computers are machines that help us with logic work or thinking work the way physical machines help us with manual work.
to do what they do computers have to do 4 different things.
- take input
- store information
- process it 
- output results
all computers have these 4 things in common, regardless of the form or shape they take. 



## Terminology
- ###### input 
        what goes into the computer
- ###### storage
        translates the input, weather it is a touch on a screen or a click of the mouse, into 
        an abstract to be stored so that it can be referenced during the next two steps
- ###### Processing
        computer takes stored information and process it using algorithm which is a series of commands then sends information 
        back to be stored in memory. this continues until the processed information is ready to be out put. 
- ###### Output
        how the information is output depends on what the computer was designed to do. it could use a screen or even be output
        to a different computer to be processed in a yet a different way. 

## data and binary
    information is stored electronicaly in the form of a series of on/off switches. weather a switch is on or off is indicated with
    a 1 or a 0. a single circut an only be on or off. but when taken as a series, a combination of "on or off"  circuts can be used to 
    represent more complex data. this is what is being referenced when you talk about a computer being 32 bit or 64 bit and everones favorite 
    nostalgia, 8bit. 
Binary refers to the use of 2 digits to represent any quantity. to store non-integer data in binary, you simply asign each peice of info
as a number and then the number becomes basically the avatar of the information. 

## circuts
    circuts combine the input information and the stored information to produce a result
