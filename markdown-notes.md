# Markdown Notes

this is a living document and will be added to as I come across special/esoteric use-cases for which I would like a handy reference

## Overview

Markdown is a language for making webpages specifically within the GitHub platform and is used to style and format text. It uses special characters in varying combinations to create these effects. Fundamental Styling includes `#` for **Headings** and `_` for _italic_ Below are a few other more complex but important fundamental styling elements in a list format (use `-` and a space to delineate bulleted list)


- **Inline Code**
    This is a way of making a phrase of code stand out from the content around it to make it easily identifiable;  `the symbol for designating inline code is ` ` `
    
- **Images** 
    Images can be uploaded as well using `![*title of image*](*url goes here*)`:
