# The Growth Mindset
A mindset is like a filter through wich you choose to veiw your experiences, events and even your own thoughts. Particularily when learning something new it is important to maintain a mindset that allows you to continue on in spite of any challenges, criticisms or obstacles below are three things I will do to maintain a growth Mindset!

  - Embrace Challenge
    remember that:
    ``` "The only easy day was yesterday" ~Richard Marcinco~ 
    ```
    when face with something challenging I can re-frame it ito something positive by realizing that everything is difficult until it isn't challenges only appear significant when they seem to be outside of the norm. If challenge **Is** the norm, theres nothing to worry about!
  - Accept Effort
    nothing worth doing comes without effort. when tempted to give up or plaged with self-doubt I must remind myself that
    ``` "Nothing good rolls downhill, you have to climb up hill ***through*** the crap, to reach the summit of reward" ~paraphrased from John C. Maxwell
    ```
    
   - Criticism
     We are designed to function on feedback, we colloquially refer to this as criticism and it's very easy in our society today to allow the word "Criticism" to carry a negative conotation and view it as a personal attack on our self worth. I don't have a handy quote or anecdote but it will be important to remind myself that criticism is like a fertilizer for a garden, an element of growth; and not a flurry of knives come to destroy
