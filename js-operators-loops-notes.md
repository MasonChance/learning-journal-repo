# Operators and Loops Overview


## Comparison Operators
- just like arithmatic, code uses operators operators are symbols that tell the script how to process the expressions they refer to. 
- `==` means equal to. (remember `=` means assigned not equal)\
- `===` means **strictly equal to** this compares both the value *and* the type of the expressions
- parenthesis create groupings so the script knows what to do and in what order to do it. 
- 



## Logical Operators
- Logical "and" `&&` operator `both expressions must be true' for the parent expression to be true
- Logical "or" `||` operator either expression can be true for the parent expression to be true
- Logical "not" `!` operator inverts the returned value of a statement. 

## Loops and Loop Counters
- keyword `for` indicates start of a loop
    - for each instance of this, do that
- keyword `while` indicates start of loop
    as long as this value exists, do that
- keyword `do while` indicates start of loop
    as do this only while you do that. kind of like when.
