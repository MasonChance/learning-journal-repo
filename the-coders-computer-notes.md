```
Code revolves around text and our ability to manipulate it efficiently it is to this purpose that we use text editors. These are different from IDEs or "*Integrated Development Environments*" in that they only manage text, while an IDE has an entire array of parallel and peripherial software in edition to text editing.

## Key Features to keep in mind when chooseing a text editor

  - Code Completion
  - A variety of themes
  - Syntax Highlighting
  - Available Extension Variety

## The Command Line

The Command Line is used to interface with your computer and the applications on it in place of the GUI or "*Graphic User Interface*" it is more efficient and puts a broader range of actions and tools at your disposal. The terminal is how you access the command line and difffernt interfaces are used based on your OS. Almost all of the Commands originate in Linux but work for both windows and Mac OS's as well. 
a couple of key commands are listed below

  - **PWD**  Print Working Directory: shows you which file directory you are currently in by name rather than an open window as in the GUI
  - **ls** List: shows what files exist in that working Directory
  - **cd** Change Directory: allows you to navigate amongst the directories on your computer. this command must be followed by a directory location.
