# JS Intro to Expressions and Operators


## Overview


## Process and work flow
1. Define goal
1. Design script
    - create flow-chart
    - identify variables
    - identify methods
    - identify conditions
    - identify operators
1. Code the steps
    - go one line at a time
    - then each block at a time
    - use the console in dev tools

<!--see page 18 in ducket, create flowchart and add file here correlate with pg.23 flowchart key describing the categories of script design-->




## Expressions

an expression evaluates into a single value just like in algebra. in general terms there are two main categories of expression
- Assignments
- comparisons or "equations" (note that `=` does not always have the same semantic meaning as in maths)


## Operators

operators are the symbols that tell the script what to do with the expressions and how to interpret them. operators are divided into types by what they accomplish
- Assingment opperations
- Arithmatic
- string (more on data types in another section)
- comparison opperators
- logical operators


## Functions

functions group a series of expressions together with operators to perform a specific task. 

take input, processes input, and do something with it reference pg90 for function syntax and composition.
encapsulation is the same as nesting, it prevents a script from applying its assignmnets and opperations to the entire page,
and lets the browser read it **only when it is called** "calling a function"  is different from giving your html *access to the file with `<script>` tag*. 
Calls are made **in** the .jsfile and the html then references the call and not the file as a whole.  functions must be called to work.
terms/expressions inside the `()` of a function are called parameters
