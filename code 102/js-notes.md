# Java script Overview

```
Javascript is a language that allows the introduction of functions like prompts, buttons, data entry fields, and dynamic content into a website.
the language makes use of assignable variables to hold information, methods to define the information and how the browser should interact with it;
And conditions that guide the browser through the methods and variables in a defined way to return the desired result.

```


## Important Terms
- variable: written in code as `var`
- methods: usually indicated with `()`
- conditions: tell the script what it is looking for and provides a check value to check it's operations against
-

## Example of JavaScript 
```
var today= new Date();  `*<-- variable*`
var hourNow= today.getHours(); ` today.getHours() is a method `
var greeting;

if(hourNow > 18){
    greeting = 'Good evening';

}else if (hourNow > 12){ 
    greeting = 'Good afternoon!';

}else if (hourNow > 0){
    greeting = 'Good morning!';

}else {
    greeting = 'Welcome!';

}

document.write('<h3>' + greeting + '</h3>') ` this is a function that will execute when the sript runs. notice it exists **outside** of the "()" `

```

## Function and assignment symbol Reference

- `var` sets a variable
- `=` does not mean equal but rather means "assign"
- `{}` begin and end a code block, these tell the browser when and where to stop reading a method and move to the next in the priority stack based on it's conditional returns
- `;` ends a phrase within the code telling the browser it can run the phrase independently of any other phrase in the code block. ***very important not to forget these***
- `==` only compares **characters** in a code line it *ignores* data types
- `===` compares ***characters and types***
- `
