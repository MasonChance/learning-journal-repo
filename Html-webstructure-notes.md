# Hyper Text Markup Language

HTML is a semantic language that both we, the user, and the browser on a client computer have in common. its what allows us to talk to each other at a deeper level than the Graphic User Interface can give us. helps to create that GUI infact. when we understand HTML we are able to control and build a website. 

## Key Terms
    
    - Site Map: organizes the raw data and allows for visualization of data grouping
    - Wire Frame: outlines the site elements and greats the beginings of structure for the content
    - Content: this is what will actually go into the elements once the wireframe has been executed in html



## Giving the site Direction
    - it is important to have a clear idea of the Purpose of the site. without clearly defined purpose the site will be messy, disjointed and unappealing
    - to better define the purpose of the site, it can be helpful to clarify the target demographic in more detail than "everybody" make imaginary client lists if necessary but demographic data can also be collected a number of other ways. 
    - from here you can start to imagine the end users motivations and specific goals or needs that they have that you will meet or exceed with your site. 
    - now its time to build a site map and wireframe

### Overveiw of site design process/theory
    - decide on the content including logo's links, images, liscencing and copyright info, etc. 
    - prioritize the information, most of us don't actually read every word of every page
    - group the content by similarity and relevance as a starting point
    - use visual contrast and other elements of Visual Hierarchy to make the page appealing and easy to use
    - **pay special attention to how navigation will work, none of us likes a clunky difficult to use page!**
