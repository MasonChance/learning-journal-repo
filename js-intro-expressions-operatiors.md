# JS Intro to Expressions and Operators


## Overview


## Process and work flow
1. Define goal
1. Design script
    - create flow-chart
    - identify variables
    - identify methods
    - identify conditions
    - identify operators
1. Code the steps
    - go one line at a time
    - then each block at a time
    - use the console in dev tools

<!--see page 18 in ducket, create flowchart and add file here correlate with pg.23 flowchart key describing the categories of script design-->




## Expressions

an expression evaluates into a single value just like in algebra. in general terms there are two main categories of expression
- Assignments
- comparisons or "equations" (note that `=` does not always have the same semantic meaning as in maths)


## Operators

operators are the symbols that tell the script what to do with the expressions and how to interpret them. operators are divided into types by what they accomplish
- Assingment opperations
- Arithmatic
- string (more on data types in another section)
- comparison opperators
- logical operators


## Functions

functions group a series of statements together to perform a task. functions can be re-used if they indicate a task that needs to be repeated

<!--takes input, processes input, does something with it
    reference pg90 for function syntax and composition
   !clarify usage of the word argument in programing context 
   encapsulation is the same as nesting, it prevents a script from applying its assignmnets an opperations to the entire page and lets the browser read it **only when it is called**
   "calling a function"  is different from giving your html *access to the file with `<script>` tag* calls are made **in** the .jsfile. functions must be called to work.
   terms/expressions inside the `()` of a function are called parameters -->
